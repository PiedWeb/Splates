# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

Contributions are accepted via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/piedweb/splates).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to run `composer format`.
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the README and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider release cycle** - We try to follow semver. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

## Running Tests

```bash
$ composer test
```

## Docs

Docs are served with hugo running on version 0.79 or later.

**Happy coding**!
